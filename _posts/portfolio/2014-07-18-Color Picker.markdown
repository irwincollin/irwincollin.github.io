description: This color picker was a project I made for the Android Development class taught by Dave Small at UF. It allowed the user to select a range of hues, saturations, and values. After the final range was selected, the user could do a query for more colors or similar colors. <br> <video width="385" height="682" controls> <source src="/img/portfolio/AndroidColorPicker.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support this video.</video>
