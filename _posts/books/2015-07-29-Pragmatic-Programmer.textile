description: The Pragmatic Programmer is a book you'll hear recommended at least a few times throughout your career as a computer scientist. Essentially a compilation of tips, advice, and best practices, the Pragmatic Programmer hopes to turn the reader into a "more effective and productive programmer" with a backbone of pragmatism.<br>With only 300 pages filling up the 46 sections, the book definitely takes to breadth rather than depth, but I actually feel this is a boon for the beginner. Although it is probably not worth the cover-to-cover read for any advanced developer, a student can really get a feel for how much there is to the art of programming. A student's studies and interests might be fueled by any individual section within the book. In addition, even a cursory knowledge of most of the contents can prove highly useful in work or in school.<br>If you're not a student or a beginner, then I still recommend you check the book out from your local library or book store and page through. If there is anything you're unfamiliar with, take a few minutes to read the section. You never know where you might have a gap in your knowledge.<br><br>Notes coming soon!
