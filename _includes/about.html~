                    <p>As for me? Well I'm a junior software engineer just like the title says! Right now I'm at the University of Florida working on my degreein Computer Science. In the next two semesters I'll be taking 6 C.S. classes! I also enjoy lifting, cycling, eating, lots of eating, and much much more. I could write a book about myself... I'll call it a life-writing... a biography!</p>
